A very simple stack based VM.

As part of learning Haskell through implementing little projects I decided I'd also like to learn how a stack based VM works. This project is the combination of those interests -- a simple stack based VM written in Haskell.

You can follow along with the development of the code on my [YouTube live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eixMdDiM0zQ&list=PL_xLFzLxV97dIw2UcU4MUxPjoUgGgMdzf)

**WARNING** I don't know what I'm doing so this code is not a great example of how to write a VM, nor a great example of Haskell. I'm working on it as a learning tool, not as a demonstration of how to do things.
